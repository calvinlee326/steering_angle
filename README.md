# Steering Angle Prediction for Quanser QCar(aiot_simulation_project)

This project implements a computer vision-based steering angle prediction system for the Quanser QCar platform. It utilizes deep learning techniques to analyze road images and predict appropriate steering angles, contributing to autonomous driving technology.


## Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Analyzes road images and predicts steering angles in real-time.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Employs a sophisticated neural network for accurate angle estimation.
- **Hardware Integration**: Compatible with Quanser QCar and Logitech G923 steering wheel and pedals.
- **Visualization**: Provides intuitive visual output of prediction results.
- **Multi-condition Support**: Robust performance across various road conditions and environments.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch (specify which one you're using)
- **Data Processing**: NumPy
- **Hardware Control**: Quanser Real-Time Control Software, Logitech G HUB Software

## Hardware

- Quanser QCar
- Logitech G923 Steering Wheel and Pedals
- (Add any other specific hardware components you're using)
